The basic TMYCIN files are:

readme           This file
tmycin.lsp       Code
arl.lsp          Abbreviated Rule Language option
tmdoc.tex        Documentation, LaTex source
tmdoc.doc        Documentation, lineprinter style
rocks.lsp        Very small demo expert system to identify rocks
rocks.tst        Test run of rocks.lsp
snakes.lsp       Demo expert system to identify snakes
snakes.tst       Test run of snakes.lsp
gcaux.lsp        Lisp functions for use with Gold Hill Common Lisp

Do not load both snakes and rocks into the same execution of TMYCIN,
since they share parameter names and cause errors if loaded together.

TMYCIN is written in Common Lisp.  It should run in any of the large
commercial Common Lisp implementations.  It will run in AKCL (Austin
Kyoto Common Lisp).  AKCL and Xakcl (AKCL with an interface to X
windows) are free, run on many Unix machines, and can be obtained
by FTP from rascal.ics.utexas.edu .

TMYCIN will run using the student version of Gold Hill Common Lisp
with the addition of the file gcaux.lsp ; it is also necessary to
edit the TMYCIN file as described in gcaux.lsp .
